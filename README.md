# Web App Project
## Introduction
You've now learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Congratulations!

In this project you will use all that you know to put together a project of your own design. Take a look at some of the demos if you need some inspiration, but use your imagination and make this project your own!! It could be anything!

You will work in a group of 3-4 students over the course of 6 weeks to bring your project to life. You will use a technique called "Agile Programming" (more on that later) as you work together and you will collaborate using GitHub to maintain and combine your individual contributions.

## Agile Programming
Also called "Scrum", Agile Programming is a method where...

## Timeline
This project will take 6 weeks. I will grade your progress at the end of each week. At the end of your 3rd week I expect a "working" product. It might not do everything you want, but it should perform the most basic goal of your project. From that point on, your job is to add features and refinements to it.

## Requirements
### STRUCTURE (index.html)
All of your HTML goes here. Do not include any additional HTML files.

### FORM (webapp.css)
All style information goes here. Do not include any additional CSS files. Your web app needs to be responsive.

### LOGIC (webapp.js)
All of your javascript goes here. You may use jQuery also, if you wish.

I'm looking for considerable effort here; 20 lines of code isn't going to cut it. There are 4 of you. You should easily be able to produce at least 200 lines of working code, with switch statements, if/else, functions, loops, and **comments that document what your code is supposed to do.** Plan accordingly!
