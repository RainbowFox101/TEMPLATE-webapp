# Web App Project

## Introduction

You've now learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Congratulations!

In this project you will use all that you know to put together a project of your own design. Take a look at some of the demos if you need some inspiration, but use your imagination and make this project your own!! It could be anything!

You will work in a group of 4-5 students over the course of 8 weeks to bring your project to life. You will use a technique called "Agile Programming" (more on that below) as you work together and you will collaborate using GitHub to maintain and combine your individual contributions.

## Timeline

This project will take 8 weeks. I will grade your progress at the end of each week. Halfway through I expect a "working" product. It might not do everything you want, but it should perform the most basic goal of your project. From that point on, your job is to add features and refinements to it.

## Requirements

### STRUCTURE (index.html)

All of your HTML goes here. Do not include any additional HTML files.

### FORM (webapp.css)

All style information goes here. Do not include any additional CSS files. Your web app needs to be responsive.

### LOGIC (webapp.js)

All of your javascript goes here. You may use jQuery also, if you wish.

## Tips

1. **Don't bite off more than you can chew!**
2. **Focus on your strengths!** If your group feels very creative and strong with HTML/CSS then focus on that... but it had better be original and look amazing! (And of course, you still need to use *some* JavaScript)
3. **Browse the web for ideas**, but don't use someone else's code if you can't understand it, and *customize it to your own needs.*
4. **Divide and conquer!** Teams work best when each member is given a task to solve (Scrum Master, this is your job). If you've got a *really* difficult task, maybe have everyone come up with their own solution and see whose solution is best!

## Agile (or "Scrum") Programming

### Overview
Work is broken down into manageable, bite-sized chunks called **Sprints**. Each Sprint will consist of 1 week and should result in a **Potentially Shippable Product** with an incremental improvement upon the previous week.

### Definitions

#### Roles

- **Product Owner (Mr. Scheuerlein)**
- **Scrum Master (rotation throughout)**: *You will run the meetings at the start and end of each period. Determine which projects everyone is working on. It will be your responsibility to approve/disapprove pull requests. At the end of the week, meet with the Product Owner to determine what goes into the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint and how much value to assign to each User Story.*
- **Team**: *Developers, testers, writers, etc. You may need to do some research to complete your project!*

#### Artifacts

- **Product Backlog**: *This is a complete set of User Stories that describe the features you want in your final product.*
- **User Stories**: *These are a way of describing a feature-set. The most important User Stories get put into the Sprint Backlog.*
- **Sprint Backlog**: *This contains the User Stories which you intend to complete this week.*

#### Ceremonies

- **Sprint Planning**: *The Scrum Master meets with the Product Owner at the end of the week to determine which User Stories will be placed into next week's Sprint Backlog.*
- **Daily Scrum**: *A brief meeting at the beginning of each class period. Discuss what you've completed since your last meeting, what you are working on, and anything that might need help.*
- **Sprint Review**: *This is done at the end of each week. Demonstrate your product to the Product Owner and discuss what could be done to improve the work process.*

#### Potentially Shippable Product

The idea here is that someone could download your web app and use it as is. Think of it like this: Instagram's (or Clash of Clans, or whatever) iOS app hasn't always had all of the features that it does, but when it was first released it was "complete". Today's version is also "complete", they've just added features and fixed bugs over time.

## Grading

### Sprint Notes (10 points each / 80 points total / 51% of the overall project)

At the end of each week, Scrum Masters will submit their notes for grading. The entire group will receive this grade.

### Halfway Point (25 points / 16% of the overall project)

At this point in the project your web app should be a **potentially shippable product** (see definitions above). I will download the dev branch of your code base and grade it according to the included final product's rubric (but cut in half). I will determine if it is ready to merge into the master branch ("release day"). If it is ready then we will merge it with the master branch. Either way, you will continue by working on your dev branch.

### Final Product (50 points / 32% of the overall project)

I will be grading the final product according to the included rubric.
